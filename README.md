# discord2pushover

## Overview

`discord2pushover` is a command-line application for Linux that monitors Discord messages in channels your bot is part of. Based on a flexible ruleset defined in a YAML configuration file, it can send notifications to [Pushover](https://pushover.net/). It's designed for foreground operation, making it suitable for integration with systemd or container environments.

Key functionalities include:
- Watching for new messages in Discord channels.
- Sending customizable Pushover notifications.
- Handling Pushover's emergency-priority notifications, including tracking acknowledgment status and reacting on Discord once acknowledged.
- Allowing emoji reactions on Discord messages when rules are matched.
- Supporting environment variable substitution within the configuration file for sensitive data.

## Features

- **Discord Message Monitoring**: Listens to messages in real-time.
- **Pushover Notifications**: Sends messages to specified Pushover users or groups.
- **Configurable Rules Engine**: Define detailed rules to filter messages based on:
    - Channel ID
    - Message reactions (emojis)
    - Bot @mentions
    - Specific user/role @mentions
    - Keywords in message content
- **Emergency Alert Handling**:
    - Supports Pushover's emergency priority (Priority 2).
    - Tracks acknowledgment status of emergency alerts via Pushover API.
    - Reacts on the original Discord message with a configurable emoji when an emergency alert is acknowledged.
    - Handles expiry of emergency alerts.
- **Discord Reactions**: Can automatically add a configurable emoji reaction to a Discord message when a rule matches.
- **Environment Variable Substitution**: Securely pass sensitive data (like tokens) into the configuration file using environment variables (e.g., `$DISCORD_TOKEN`, `${PUSHOVER_APP_KEY}`).
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles SIGINT/SIGTERM signals for clean shutdown.
- **Version Information**: Provides build version via `-version` flag.

## Configuration (`discord2pushover.yaml`)

The application looks for its configuration file in the following order:
1.  Path specified by the `-c` command-line flag (e.g., `-c /path/to/your/config.yaml`).
2.  `discord2pushover.yaml` in the current working directory.
3.  `discord2pushover.yml` in the current working directory.

If no configuration file is found, the application will print an error and exit.

### Global Settings

These settings are at the top level of your YAML file:

-   `discordToken`: (string, required) Your Discord Bot Token. **Important**: This must be a Bot token, not a user token. Example: `"YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"`
-   `pushoverUserKey`: (string, required for some test scenarios, but typically per-rule) Your personal Pushover User Key. While it can be global, most notifications will use a `pushoverDestination` defined in a rule's actions. Example: `"YOUR_PUSHOVER_USER_KEY"`
-   `pushoverAppKey`: (string, required) Your Pushover Application API Token. You need to register an application on the Pushover site to get this. Example: `"YOUR_PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN"`

### Environment Variable Substitution

You can embed environment variables in your YAML configuration file. The application will replace placeholders like `"$VAR_NAME"` or `"${VAR_NAME}"` with the actual value of the `VAR_NAME` environment variable at startup. If an environment variable is not set, the placeholder string will remain as is (as of current implementation, though this might change to error out or use an empty string in strict mode later).

Example:
```yaml
discordToken: "$BOT_TOKEN"
pushoverAppKey: "${MY_PUSHOVER_APP_KEY}"
```

### Rules

The `rules` section is a list of rule objects. Rules are evaluated from top to bottom for each incoming Discord message. The first rule that matches all its conditions will have its actions triggered, and **no further rules will be processed for that message.**

Each `rule` object has the following structure:

-   `name`: (string, optional) A descriptive name for the rule. This is useful for logging and debugging.
    Example: `"Critical Error Alert"`
-   `conditions`: (object, required) An object defining the conditions that must ALL be met for this rule to trigger. If a condition field is omitted (e.g., `channelID` is not specified), that condition is considered to be met (i.e., it doesn't filter).
    -   `channelID`: (string, optional) The specific Discord channel ID to monitor. If omitted, the rule applies to messages from any channel the bot has access to.
        Example: `"123456789012345678"`
    -   `messageHasEmoji`: ([]string, optional) A list of emoji names (Unicode emoji character or custom emoji name without colons). The condition is met if the Discord message has a reaction with ANY of these emojis.
        Example: `["üî•", "alert_emoji"]`
    -   `reactToAtMention`: (boolean, optional) If `true`, the message must @mention the bot itself (either directly or via @everyone/@here). Defaults to `false` if omitted.
        Example: `true`
    -   `specificMentions`: ([]string, optional) A list of Discord User IDs or Role IDs. The condition is met if the message mentions ANY of these users or roles.
        Example: `["U123ABCDEFG", "R098ZYXWVU"]`
    -   `contentIncludes`: ([]string, optional) A list of keywords. ALL keywords in this list must be present in the message content for the condition to be met. The check is case-insensitive.
        Example: `["error", "database connection failed"]`
-   `actions`: (object, required) Defines the actions to take if all conditions are met.
    -   `pushoverDestination`: (string, required) The Pushover user key or group key to send the notification to.
        Example: `"uMyPushoverUserKey"` or `"gMyPushoverGroupKey"`
    -   `priority`: (integer, required) The Pushover notification priority. Valid values are:
        -   `-2`: Lowest
        -   `-1`: Low
        -   `0`: Normal
        -   `1`: High
        -   `2`: Emergency (requires `emergency` block below)
        Example: `1`
    -   `reactionEmoji`: (string, optional) A Unicode emoji or a custom Discord emoji name (without colons) to react with on the original Discord message.
        Example: `"‚úÖ"` or `"custom_reaction"`
    -   `emergency`: (object, optional) This block is **required if and only if `priority` is `2` (Emergency)**.
        -   `ackEmoji`: (string, required for emergency) The emoji to react with on the Discord message once the Pushover emergency notification has been acknowledged by a user.
            Example: `"üëç"`
        -   `expire`: (integer, required for emergency) The Pushover `expire` parameter in seconds. This is the duration for which Pushover will keep trying to send the notification until it's acknowledged or expires. Maximum is 10800 seconds (3 hours), but Pushover recommends values up to 3600 (1 hour) for their retry/expire mechanism. This also dictates how long the bot will track the acknowledgement.
            Example: `3600` (1 hour)
        -   `retry`: (integer, required for emergency) The Pushover `retry` parameter in seconds. This defines how often Pushover should resend the notification within the `expire` period. Minimum is 30 seconds.
            Example: `60` (resend every 60 seconds)

### Example Configuration

```yaml
# Global settings
discordToken: "$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" # Replaced by environment variable DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
pushoverAppKey: "${PUSHOVER_APP_KEY}" # Replaced by environment variable PUSHOVER_APP_KEY

rules:
  - name: "Critical System Alert with Emoji"
    conditions:
      channelID: "123456789012345678" # Specific channel
      messageHasEmoji: ["üî•", "sos"] # If message has üî• OR sos reaction
      contentIncludes: ["critical", "system down"] # Must contain BOTH "critical" AND "system down"
    actions:
      pushoverDestination: "uYourPushoverUserKey"
      priority: 2 # Emergency
      reactionEmoji: "üö®" # Bot reacts with üö® on Discord
      emergency:
        ackEmoji: "‚úÖ" # Bot reacts with ‚úÖ when Pushover alert is acknowledged
        expire: 3600 # Pushover will retry for 1 hour; bot tracks for this long.
        retry: 60    # Pushover retries every 60 seconds.

  - name: "Mentions for Support Team"
    conditions:
      specificMentions: ["R98765432109876543"] # Specific role mention
      # reactToAtMention: false (default)
    actions:
      pushoverDestination: "gSupportGroupKey" # Send to a Pushover group
      priority: 1 # High
      reactionEmoji: "üîî"

  - name: "DB Error in Any Channel"
    conditions:
      contentIncludes: ["database error"] # Message must contain "database error"
    actions:
      pushoverDestination: "uDBAdminUserKey"
      priority: 0 # Normal
      reactionEmoji: "üíæ"

  - name: "Bot Mention General"
    conditions:
      reactToAtMention: true # If bot is @mentioned
    actions:
      pushoverDestination: "uYourPushoverUserKey"
      priority: 0
      # No reactionEmoji for this rule
```

## Building

To build the application, ensure you have Go installed (version 1.18 or later recommended).

```bash
go build .
```
This will create a `discord2pushover` executable in the current directory.

## Running

Execute the binary, optionally providing a path to your configuration file:

```bash
./discord2pushover -c /path/to/your/discord2pushover.yaml
```

If the configuration file is named `discord2pushover.yaml` or `discord2pushover.yml` and located in the same directory as the executable, you can run it without the `-c` flag:

```bash
./discord2pushover
```

### Required Discord Bot Permissions

Ensure your Discord bot has the following permissions in the channels it needs to monitor and react in:
-   **View Channels** (also known as Read Messages)
-   **Read Message History**
-   **Add Reactions**

(Note: "Send Messages" permission is not strictly required for basic operation unless future features sending messages are added.)

## Signal Handling

The application listens for `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM` signals. Upon receiving either of these, it will attempt to shut down gracefully by:
1.  Stopping the emergency acknowledgment poller.
2.  Closing the connection to Discord.
3.  Exiting.

## Version

To print the version information (version, commit hash, build date), use the `-version` flag:

```bash
./discord2pushover -version
```

This information is embedded at build time if building from a Git repository.
